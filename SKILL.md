# Six Hats Debate Skill

## How It Works

1. **User submits the topic** — paste the decision, plan, or question in chat.
2. **User specifies output path** — e.g. `Projects/my-debate/` or any path.
3. **Skill runs 3 rounds** of sequential debate, one hat at a time.
4. **Blue hat moderates** — summarizes and provides the final recommendation.
5. **Summary written to `{output_path}/debate-{timestamp}.md`**.

## The Six Hats

| Hat | Role | Focus |
|-----|------|-------|
| **White** | Facts & Information | What do we know? What's unknown? What data exists? |
| **Red** | Emotion & Intuition | Gut feelings, hunches, what feels wrong even without evidence |
| **Yellow** | Optimism & Benefits | Why could this work? What's the best outcome? |
| **Black** | Caution & Risks | What could go wrong? What are the failure modes? |
| **Green** | Creativity & Alternatives | New ideas, different approaches, lateral thinking |
| **Blue** | Process & Moderation | Orchestrates the debate, manages time, writes final summary |

## Debate Rules

- Each hat speaks **sequentially**: White → Red → Yellow → Black → Green → Blue
- **Round 1**: Each hat responds to the original topic
- **Round 2**: Each hat sees Round 1 output and can counter, amplify, or concede
- **Round 3**: Final statements — hats can shift positions based on the debate
- **Blue hat** does not contribute opinions during rounds; only moderates and summarizes at the end

## Output Format

```markdown
# Six Hats Debate: {topic}

**Date**: {timestamp}
**Rounds**: 3

## Final Recommendation (Blue Hat)

*Synthesized conclusion and recommended course of action.*

---

## Round 1

### White Hat
{facts and information}

### Red Hat
{emotion and intuition}

### Yellow Hat
{optimism and benefits}

### Black Hat
{caution and risks}

### Green Hat
{creativity and alternatives}

---

## Round 2

{...same structure...}

## Round 3

{...same structure...}

---

## Raw Debate Data

{all hat statements in order, unfiltered}
```

---

## Workflow

1. Read this SKILL.md
2. Ask user for the **topic** and **output path**
3. Run Round 1 — prompt each hat sequentially, collect responses
4. Run Round 2 — feed Round 1 back to each hat, collect responses
5. Run Round 3 — feed Round 2 back to each hat, collect responses
6. Blue hat synthesizes → writes final recommendation
7. Write complete debate file to `{output_path}/debate-{timestamp}.md`
8. Report file path to user

## Notes

- Do not run hats in parallel — sequential builds better debate momentum
- If the topic is too vague, ask the user to clarify before starting
- Each round must complete fully before moving to the next round
- Always write the output file — do not skip this step
